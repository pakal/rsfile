def rsopen(name=None, mode="r", buffering=None, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, fileno=None, handle=None, closefd=True,

    """
    This function is a factory similar to :func:`io.open`, which returns chains of I/O streams targeting files, with
    a focus set on security and concurrency protections.
    
    ``name`` is the path to the file, in case no existing fileno or handle is provided for wrapping 
    through the ``fileno``/``handle`` arguments.

    ``mode`` is the access mode of the stream, it can be given either as a standard mode string, or as an advanced mode string 
    (see :ref:`file opening modes<file_opening_modes>`). 
    
    ``closefd`` (boolean) can only be False when wrapping a fileno or a handle, and in this case the wrapped 
    stream will not be closed when the stream objects are closed.
 
    .. note:: 
            For backward compatibility, when using standard modes, it is still possible to provide 
            a fileno for wrapping directly as the ``name`` argument, but this way of proceeding is deprecated.

    ``buffering``, ``encoding``, ``errors``, and ``newline`` arguments have the same meaning as in :func:`io.open`.
    
    .. warning::
    
        Like io.open(), if buffering is 0, this function returns a raw stream, the methods of which
        only issue one system call. So in this case, checking the number of bytes written/read after 
        each operation is highly advised.
        
    
    If ``locking`` is True, the file will immediately be fully locked on opening, with a 
    default share mode (exclusive for writable streams, shared for read-only streams) 
    and the ``timeout`` argument provided. This is particularly useful is the file is opened in 
    "truncation" mode, as it prevents this truncation from happening without inter-process protection.
    Note that it is still possible to abort that locking with a call to :meth:`unlock` (without arguments).

    If ``thread_safe`` is True, the chain of streams returned by the function will be wrapped into 
    a thread-safe interface ; in this case, if ``mutex`` is provided, it is used as the concurrency lock, 
    else a new lock is created (a multiprocessing RLock() if the stream is inheritable, else a threading RLock(). 

    The ``permissions`` argument will simply be forwarded to the lowest level stream, 
    so as to be applied in case a file creation occurs (note : decimal '511' corresponds to octal '0777', i.e whole permissions).

        FILE OPENING MODES
    
    In addition to standard modes as described in the documentation of :func:`io.open`,
    a set of advanced modes is available, as capital-case flags. These advanced modes
    should be combinated in the order listed below, for ease of reading. Standard and advanced 
    modes may not be mixed together.
    
    ========= ===============================================================
    Character Meaning
    ========= ===============================================================
    'R'       Stream is Readable
    'W'       Stream is Writable
    'A'       Stream is in Append mode (implicitly enforces W)
    '+'       File must be created (i.e it mustn't already exist)
    '-'       File must NOT be created (i.e it must already exist)
    'S'       Stream is Synchronized
    'I'       Stream is Inheritable
    'E'       File is Erased on opening
    'B'       Stream is in Binary mode
    'T'       Stream is in Text mode (default)
    ========= ===============================================================
    
    .. note:: 
        The '+' flag doesn't work on NFS shares with a linux kernel < 2.6.5, race conditions may occur.
    
    ========= =====================
    Mode Equivalences
    ===============================
    'r'           'R+'
    'w'           'WE'
    'a'           'A'
    'r+'          'RW+'
    'w+'          'RWE'
    'a+'          'RA'
    '...b'        '...B'
    '...t'        '...T'
