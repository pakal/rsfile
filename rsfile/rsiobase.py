    This abstract base class is only used to document the **additional/modified** features of rsfile streams,
    compared to those of the stdlib `io.IOBase` subclasses. Unless stated otherwise, all methods and attributes
    documented for the `io` module also exist on rsfile sreams, with a compatible behaviour.

    Advanced streams can be found in the *rsfile* package, as classes named *RSFileIO*, *RSBufferedReader*,
    *RSBufferedWriter*, *RSBufferedRandom*, *RSTextIOWrapper* and *RSThreadSafeWrapper*.
    However, you shouldn't have to deal with them directly, since RSOpen() takes care of instantiating them properly.
    Also note that the signature of *RSFileIO* differs quite much from its stdlib counterpart, because of its enhanced
    capabilities.

          after the new end of file are discarded.
        - In case of extension, the content
          of the byte range added depends on ``zero_fill``. If it is True, new bytes
          will always appear as zeros (but file truncation can then be quite slow on
          filesystems which don't support sparse files, such as FAT). If it is False,

        An implicit flush() always happens first, to empty python-level buffers.

        If ``full_flush`` is True (only works on OSX for now), RSFileIO will
        try to ensure that data is really written to permanent storage, since
        disk devices might else keep data in their cache for out-of-order writing.
        If full flush is successful, metadata gets written as well.

        If no full flush took place, if ``metadata`` is False,
        and if the platform supports it (win32 and OSX don't),
        this sync is a "datasync", i.e only data and file sizes are written to disk, not
        file times and other metadata (this can improve performance, at the cost of some
        incoherence in filesystem state).

        If None of the above works, a standard sync() is attempted, i.e pushing both data and 
        metadata up to the disk device.

        Note that the file's parent directory is not necessarily updated synchronously, so
        some risks of data loss may remain.

        see the "synchronized" argument at stream opening.

           Be sure, in particular, to read the :ref:`rsfile_locking_caveats`,
           to be aware of some limitations and dangers of these file locks.


        .. rubric::
            Parameters
        
        - *timeout* (None or positive integer):
          If timeout is None, the process will block on this operation
          until it manages to get the lock;
          else, it must be a number indicating how many seconds
          the operation will wait before raising a timeout IOError
          (thus, timeout=0 means a non-blocking locking attempt).
          Low level APIs do not support lock timeout, so it's currently emulated via repeated
          non-blocking calls (spin-lock).
          See :ref:`rsfile-options` for customization.
    
        - *length* (None or positive integer): Specifies how many bytes must be locked.
          If length is None or 0, it means *infinity*, i.e all the bytes after the 
          locking offset will be locked. It is not an error to lock bytes farther 
          than the current end of file.
          
        - *offset* (None or positive integer):
          Relative offset, starting at which bytes should be locked. 
          This position can be beyond the end of file.
        
        - *whence* (SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END):
          Whence is the same as in :meth:`io.IOBase.seek`, and specifies what the offset is
          referring to (beginning, current position, or end of file).
                
        - *shared* (None or boolean): 
          If ``shared`` is True, the lock is a "reader", non-exclusive lock, which can be
          shared by several "reader" streams, but prevents "writer" locks from being taken
          on the locked portion.
          The owner of the lock shall himself not attempt to write to the locked area if it's *shared*,
          even if file open mode allows it: it'll fail if locking is mandatory, eg. on windows.
          
          If ``shared`` is False, the lock is a "writer", exclusive lock, preventing both writer 
          and reader locks from being taken by other processes on the locked portion.
          
          By default, ``shared`` is set to False for writable streams, and to True for others.
          Note that this sharing mode can be compatible with the stream permission, i.e shared locks can only
          by taken by stream having read access, and exclusive locks are reserved to writable streams.
          Thus, this parameter is only useful for read/write streams, which can alternate between
          shared and exclusive locks depending on their needs.

        This method raises `RuntimeError` if an abnormal workflow is detected (eg. attempting the lock overlapping
        areas of the files several times through the *same* file handle, whatever the "shared" mode provided).

        On success, ``lock_file`` returns a context manager for use inside a *with* statement,
        to automatically release the lock. However, it is advised that you don't release locks 
        if you close the stream just after that: letting the close() operation release the locks
        is as efficient, and prevents some corner-case problems as described in :ref:`rsfile_locking_caveats`.

        """
