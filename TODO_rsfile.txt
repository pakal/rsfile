# IMPORTANT - sort out issues with bytes, bytearray, memoryview etc !!


SUBMIT PATCH test_fileio:

* DOES IO STREAM INHERITANCE WORK VIA PICKLE / MULTITHREADING ???????????
TODO - TEST SEMAPHORE INHERITANCE !!!!!

*Test on all python implementations, versions, on all platforms etc.

TODO - submit bug : no way to reset() C io extension buffers !! 


OPTIMISER READALL() avec join()

#TODO py2.7 the file object will now set the filename attribute on the IOError exception when trying to open a 
directory on POSIX platforms. (Noted by Jan Kaliszewski; issue 4764.)


# TODO - discuss threads in multiprocessing when forking - why not spawn like win32 ??





*Add support for sparse files on ntfs (FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA, DeviceIoControl(FSCTL_SET_SPARSE))? -> maybe useless, delayed

*How to know the count of open files for current process ? -> useless

*Make inheritable streams picklable for multiprocessing use, along with their semaphores -> long and hard, delayed

*Design a strong exception hierarchy for IO/OS errors - if it is really possible from native error codes -> delayed

*Create a global option registry to activate debugging systems (open handle counting, deadlock detection...) -> delayed
